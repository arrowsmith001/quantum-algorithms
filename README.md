# Quantum Algorithms (using QisKit)

This repository is for documenting my attempt to implement some of the most well-known and foundational quantum algorithms using Qiskit, as part of a broader effort to develop a good understanding of the principles of quantum computing, and convince myself of some of the basic results. I may also include some visualisations to aid intuition, and utilities to aid in the development of these algorithms.

## Basics

- [1-Qubit State](0_basics/0_1-qubit-state.py): Setting an arbitrary 1-qubit state starting from ∣0⟩.
- [2-Qubit State](0_basics/1_2-qubit-state.py): Setting an arbitrary 2-qubit state starting from ∣00⟩.
- [Superdense Coding](0_basics/2_superdense_coding.py): Sending two bits of information by sending a single qubit to a recipient.
- Quantum Teleportation: Transferring the state of an arbitrary qubit to a second qubit.
